        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>You can use any mods you want as long as they stay on your side and don‚Äôt give any gameplay
            advantage. To be more precise <strong>any visual or perspective mod is allowed</strong>, but anything that
            modifies even slightly the chart itself, like mirror, is not.</li>
          <li>You will need to cycle between pads in clockwise order after every song, so any inconsistency the
            pads may have will be balanced out.</li>

          <li>You can only compete on tournament pack songs except in the finals, or if explicitly indicated.</li>
          <li><strong>CMOD is completely</strong> and utterly <strong>BANNED</strong> in all disciplines.</li>

          <li><strong>Decents and way offs will be turned</strong> on during the tournament. You will also be required to play
            your <strong>qualification songs with them on</strong>.</li>

          <li>Any player who doesn‚Äôt show up when it‚Äôs their turn to play will simply get 0 points on any song
            they miss. However, if there is a legitimate reason for it, we can try to work around it by moving the
            order of the brackets. If you have any issue, please let us know in advance!</li>

          <li>If upon starting a song you notice any issue with your mods, if you feel ill or something else is
            wrong IMMEDIATELY stop and raise your hand. The round will be restarted, no harm done.</li>

            <li>If you have an issue when the song is well undeway, quietly stop, step away and ask for assistance
                after the song is over without disturbing the other players.</li>

            <li>In case of blatant technical issue, you will be allowed to replay your song while the staff will take
                a look at the problem.</li>

            <li>We will reserve the right to punish you if you disturb other players, damage the equipment, abuse
                the rules or try to argue that ‚Äúsince something is not in the rulebook then it‚Äôs allowed‚Äù just to get
                an advantage. Use common sense, be kind, be fair.</li>

                <li>Show up clean and tidy at the venue; bring towels, change of clothes and deodorant; make sure
                    to be as presentable as possible at all times. Don‚Äôt make us tell you off, we are not afraid to do so.</li>

                <li>Remember to have a good time! Before any rule and requirement, this is the reason why this
                    event even exists in the first place!</li>
