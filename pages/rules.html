        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>You can use any mods you want as long as they stay on your side and don‚Äôt give any gameplay
            advantage. To be more precise <strong>any visual or perspective mod is allowed</strong>, but anything that
            modifies even slightly the chart itself, like mirror, is not.</li>
          <li>You will need to cycle between pads in clockwise order after every song, so any inconsistency the
            pads may have will be balanced out.</li>

          <li>You can only compete on tournament pack songs except in the finals, or if explicitly indicated.</li>
          <li><strong>CMOD is completely</strong> and utterly <strong>BANNED</strong> in all disciplines.</li>

          <li><strong>Decents and way offs will be turned</strong> on during the tournament. You will also be required to play
            your <strong>qualification songs with them on</strong>.</li>

          <li>Any player who doesn‚Äôt show up when it‚Äôs their turn to play will simply <strong>get 0 points on any song
            they miss.</strong> However, if there is a legitimate reason for it, we can try to work around it by moving the
            order of the brackets. If you have any issue, please let us know in advance!</li>

          <li><strong>If upon starting a song you notice any issue with your mods</strong>, if you feel ill or something else is
            wrong <strong>IMMEDIATELY stop and raise your hand. The round will be restarted</strong>, no harm done.</li>

            <li><strong>If you have an issue when the song is well undeway,</strong> quietly stop, <strong>step away</strong> and ask for assistance
                after the song is over without disturbing the other players.</li>

            <li><strong>In case of blatant technical issue</strong>, you will be allowed to replay your song while the staff will take
                a look at the problem.</li>

            <li><strong>We will reserve the right to punish you </strong>if you disturb other players, damage the equipment, abuse
                the rules or try to argue that ‚Äúsince something is not in the rulebook then it‚Äôs allowed‚Äù just to get
                an advantage. <strong>Use common sense, be kind, be fair.</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Show up clean and tidy at the venue;</strong> bring towels, change of clothes and deodorant; make sure
                    to be as presentable as possible at all times. <strong>Don‚Äôt make us tell you off, we are not afraid to do so.</strong></li>

                <li>Remember to <strong>have a good time!</strong> Before any rule and requirement, this is the reason why this
                    event even exists in the first place!</li>
